# nubis-stacks
Collection of reusable nested stacks for the nubis project.

Each stack comes with its own readme with an example of its use.

There is a template-dist file that you can use as a base for creating a new nested stack. It includes the minimum parameters you will need in order to integrate with the nubis project. These parameters are required in order to include the required tags.

These templates are a work in progress. Issues and pull-requests are greatly appreciated.
